You checked out {} on {} and have not yet returned it to the hall office. This item is now overdue.

Please return it to the Dupre Hall Office immediately when the office is open. Hall office hours are listed below. A staff member needs to be present in the office when you turn the items in, otherwise it will be an improper check-in and you can still be charged a fee.
If the office is closed you can also call the RA on Duty from 7pm-8am, 7 days a week. 

As a reminder, if {} is not returned immediately when the office is open, you will be charged a replacement fee. 
If you have any further questions or you feel that you have received this email in error please feel free to contact RHD Samantha at syang9@macalester.edu 

Best,
